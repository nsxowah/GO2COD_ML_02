# Spam Detection through NLP: Evaluating Multiple Classification Models

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a spam detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to evaluate multiple classification models, including Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to determine their effectiveness in distinguishing between spam and ham (non-spam) messages.

  - NumPy

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains labeled text messages categorized as "ham" (non-spam) and "spam." You can find the dataset on Kaggle: [Spam Email Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahwagih/spam-emails).

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the models will be evaluated based on the following metrics:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Support
